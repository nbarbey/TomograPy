# TomograPy : A python tomography package

## What is TomograPy ?

This is a fast parallelized tomography projector/backprojector.  It originates from solar tomography applications but could be used for other applications. It uses the fast Siddon algorithm as its core. The parallelization is done with Rust's rayon library.

It was originally authored by Nicolas Barbey and is since maintained by Marcus Hughes.

## Application in solar tomography

For solar astrophysics, TomograPy performs solar tomographic reconstructions of the corona. It can take SOHO or STEREO data and output a 3-dimensional map of the corona. For now only extreme-ultraviolet data is handled but handling of coronographic data is planned along with handling of data from other spacecrafts.
